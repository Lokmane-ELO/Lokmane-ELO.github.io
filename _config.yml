  Driven by a deep-seated passion for technology, I, Lokman, embarked on my journey in the tech world with a Master's degree in Computer Science. This academic pursuit laid the groundwork for my career as a Full Stack Developer, where I've honed my skills in a diverse array of technologies, from backend frameworks like Django and Flask to frontend libraries such as React and Angular. My professional path has been marked by significant projects, including a pivotal role in deploying ML models in MÃ¡laga and currently enhancing data processes at SFR in France. My enthusiasm for full-stack development is not just about coding; it's about creating solutions that drive innovation and efficiency, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and excellence in the ever-evolving tech landscape
